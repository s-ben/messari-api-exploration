During each month, proposals are submitted to the network for voting. Masternodes will vote on the proposals, and at the end of the month successful ones will receive the requested payout from the pooled funds. Masternodes also receive payments from the network for PrivateSend and InstantSend transactions.\n\nDash experienced a technical issue in the earliest days of network functionality, which has created some controversy around the project's token distribution. A bug in the mining difficulty adjustment algorithm led to the issuance of 2 million DASH, more than 10% of all future tokens, in the first 48 hours of the network when few people were participating."}}}
