The teams decision to institute no supply cap is premised on the need to continually reward network maintainers (masternodes and stakers). \n\nBlock rewards are set at a maximum of 5 PIVX tokens per block. Approximately 16% of each block reward is added to the PIVX treasury to fund further network development, which are paid monthly through \"superblocks\" as part of the community-governed budget. Instead of static or scheduled rewards, PIVX allows the network to decide how to reward the masternode and the staker. If too many masternodes join the network, rewards will increase for stakers. If too few masternodes contribute, masternode rewards will increase. "}}}
