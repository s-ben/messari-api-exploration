The total supply of tokens will be capped at 45 billion ADA. Token sale participants received vouchers which were later redeemable for ADA through the native Daedalus wallet. Of the total eventual supply token sale participants received 57.6% (25.9 billion ADA). Member entities that support Cardano (Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo) received 11.6% of total supply (5.2 billion ADA) following the creation of the genesis block. The remaining 13.9 billion ADA will be created as ongoing rewards for PoS miners.\n\nCurrently, Cardano is in the launch phase so no fees are collected, and no ADA is minted. Once the project moves to the reward phase, new ADA will be minted, and network fees will be collected and distributed. Minted ADA and collected fees will be distributed to block producers and the Cardano Treasury, which will be governed by ADA holders."}}}
